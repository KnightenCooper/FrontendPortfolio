            Notes:
        </h3>
 
        <p>Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces{}.</p>

        <p>Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it’s a function, it’s known as a method.</p>
        
        <p>An object’s properties and methods can be accessed using either dot notation or square bracket notation.</p>
        
        <p>Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.</p>
        
        <p>Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in any order, or omitted.</p>
        
        <p>Nested objects can be created by placing objects inside objects.</p>
        
        <p>JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information.</p>
        
        <p>The Math object gives access to a number of mathematical constants.</p>
         
        <p>The Math object can be used to perform mathematical calculations.</p>
        
        <p>The Date object  can be used to create date objects.</p>
        
        <p>Once you’ve created a Date object, you can use the getter methods to access information about that date.</p>
        
        <p>Once you’ve created a Date object, setter methods can be used to change information about that date.</p>
        
        <p>The Regex object can be used to create regular expressions.</p>
