<p>I fixed a typo in the book example. The function was named dsiplayStory instead of displayStory.</p>
<p>My version of the story editor is for passwords. 
    It has javascript in a separate file, and stores password hints based on the site the user types.
    Originally I was going to place the passwords directly into localStorage, but then I read this article about why that is a terrible idea. 
    <a href="https://dev.to/rdegges/please-stop-using-local-storage-1i04">https://dev.to/rdegges/please-stop-using-local-storage-1i04</a>
That's why I decided to change it so that it just stores password clues/hints and not the actual password.</p>
<p>While trying to set this up, I realized that the two are overwriting each other. I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>Great news! I figured it out. The javascript is searching
    for the match based on what the story name or username is. Since I made a username called 'bob' and there's a story called 'bob', the newest 'bob' overwrites the other.
    To solve this I am going to add '-hint' to all the hint names. I had to change the location of '-hint' because I placed it onto the identifier instead of 
    being added to the actual username value. Everything is working now.
</p>
<p>If I have time, I want to try to add a button that records the last time you pressed the button and displays it, or something that could use
    localStorage for recent/most common searches. I think both of those could be interesting to make, but I still need to do the mobile UX prepwork. I 
    don't think I have time to do more with localStorage, but we'll see.</p>
