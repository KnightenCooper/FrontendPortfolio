    <h2>Mobile UX</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>Design for mobile first because more and more people are using mobile and it's easier to port to desktop from mobile. 
            Mobile sites should be useful, load fast, have minimal steps, and be based on one thumb reachability. Loading times can 
            be shortened by using less images, use svg/webfonts, optimize css/js files, and GZIP files. Place most commonly tapped 
            items at bottom of phone screen, and use the word 'menu' with a border instead of a hamburger button. People don't know 
            hamburger = menu. </p>
        <p>When designing mobile forms have the labels be displayed in the field and float up and smaller when tapped. Mobile forms 
            should give users option for email or phone, autocomplete, don't automatically mask/hide passwords, have mask password option, 
            a single credit card field that automatically advances, and the correct keyboard for the input. Mobile sites should link phone 
            numbers so people can click to call.</p>
        <p>When using ads on mobile ads don't use pop-ups, massive ads, keep ads small, and have ads expand when clicked. </p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <p>Linked phone number(Good): <a href="tel:417-522-4499">417-522-4499</a></p>
        <p>Static phone number(Bad): 417-522-4499</p>
        <p>Note: This phone number is real and will call a Domino's Pizza in Missouri.</p>
        <p>The next example is located at the bottom of the screen and is the bottom navigation bar that incorporates the optimal menu icon and is 
            positioned to be easiest to use for the right thumb. A user that is scrolling throught their phone with their right hand will be able 
            to quickly tap the menu button using their thumb because of its position. </p>
        <p>Note: the bottom right "MENU" icon is an interactive button that can be tapped to open and close the menu if you'd to see a working example.
        </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <section class="ad">
        <p>- This is the ideal size and position for an ad.</p>
        <p>- Ads should be in the middle of content and be small.</p>
    </section>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Another interesting thing we can do to make mobile forms better is to disable autocomplete and spellcheck. This wasn't in the video, 
                but was somthing I discovered while trying to look up how to code the form the way the video suggested. We can disable spell check by adding 
                input type="text" spellcheck="false". We can turn off autocomplete by using input type="text" autocomplete="off".</p>
            <h3>Questions:</h3>
            <p>How can I make a form that has labels that start in the field and then get smaller and move out of the way when tapped? </p>
            <p>How did they make a credit card form that automatically advanced to each new form? </p>
            <p>The author of the video said to avoid images and anything that will slow down the site, but then advised using video ads because they work better.
                Are the benefits of video ads worth having a site that loads slower? Do video ads not slow down the site as much for some reason?
            </p>
            <p>The video talked about watches. Are people using watches to surf the internet? How would I design a website for a watch and is that even worth it?</p>
            <p>How do I optimize css and js files? How do I use GZIP to decrease loading times?</p>
