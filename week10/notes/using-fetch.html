  <h2>MDN: Using Fetch</h2>
  <h2>See Console for Code Tests</h2>


      <h3>
        Notes:
      </h3>

      <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. </p>
      
      <p>It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</p>

      <p>This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest. </p>
      
      <p>Fetch provides a better alternative that can be easily used by other technologies such as Service Workers. </p>
      
      <p>Fetch also provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to HTTP.</p>
      
      <p>Example of Basic Fetch:</p>
      
      <p>fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')</p>
      <p>.then(response => response.json())</p>
      <p>.then(data => console.log(data));</p>
