            Notes:
        </h3>
       
        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.</p>

        <p>The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</p>
        
        <p>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</p>
        
        <p>ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions.</p>
        
        <p>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the function.</p>
        
        <p>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.</p>
        
        <p>The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to existing instances.</p>
        
        <p>The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method. If not, it will check that functionâ€™s prototype until it finds the method or reaches the Object constructor function.</p>
        
        <p>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function inside a constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions.</p>
        
        <p>Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.</p>
        
        <p>A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance chain.</p>
        
        <p>Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to this.</p>
        
        <p>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
        
        <p>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked around by using that = this, using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.</p>
        
        <p>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.</p>
        
        <p>Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block' objects, rather than inheriting all their properties and methods from a parent class.</p>
