            Notes:
        </h3>
        <p>Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.</p>
        <p>Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating afunction expressionby assigning an anonymous function 
          to a variable.</p>
        <p>All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.</p>
        <p>A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the functionâ€™s 
          body.</p>
        <p>An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.</p>
        <p>The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation.</p>
        <p>The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.</p>
        <p>Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.</p>
        <p>Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6.</p>
        <p>Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions 
          cannot be invoked until after they are defined.</p>
        <p>Acallbackis a function that is provided as an argument to another function.</p>
