    <h2>Chapter 2 Notes from "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition"</h2>

          <h3>Javascript Comments</h3>
        <p>
            The class is built around doing the examples in the reading and then applying those examples to self made enrichment projects. 
            At the end of each challenge I need to scedule an interview with the professor. These interviews aren't recorded or part of my grade, 
            but allow me an opportunity to discuss with the course instructor how well I am meeting the course outcomes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My actual grade is based on self evaluation and my portfolio as proof. I will submit 2 portfolios, one at mid-term, and one at the end of the semester.
            This is a link to an example portfolio: <a href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261">example portfolio</a>. To get an "A" I have to do outstanding, solve 
            complex problems, and apply the Learning Model principles. I need to be making my own examples using the material.
        </p>

        <h3>Questions About Syllabus:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
            What are the challenges?<p>(I found the answer:The syllabus recommends we interview with Brother Gedeborg after each challenge to see how things are going. Each SPA programming challenge is the challenge.)</p> 
            </li>
            <li>What is a web SPA programming challenge? <p>(I found the answer: self-chosen project, we do 2 in block 1 and 2 in block 2, total of 4)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What are we doing with our learning groups? The syllabus says there aren't group projects, but the calendar has weekly "Team Activities".
